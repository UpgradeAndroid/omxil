This folder contains the start of the new component hierarchy.

The goal is to provide a component base class or base classes that can be quickly 
used for creating new OpenMAX IL Components.

This is very much under construction and currently it doesn't yet work.

By default the compilation of these is not included in the build. To enable,
run in the top folder:

./reconf
./configure --enable-newch
./make

Remove this file after the hierarchy becomes usable.

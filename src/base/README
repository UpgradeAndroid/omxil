This folder contains the base classes used to implement the new hierarchical components.

It provides a base class for common functionality, and three components, a filter, a sink and a source.
Each final component that is one or two port can be derived from these base classes.
A base port class is also provided. It is used by the base components for the port handling, 
but it can be sued as a base class if some implementation needs to override also the port functionalities.

These base components are included in the omil library, with the core functionality,
that each final component must include.

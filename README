Bellagio OpenMAX Integration Layer  1.1 project 

This is an opensource implementation of the OpenMAX Integration Layer (IL) API, specified
by the Khronos group (see http://www.khronos.org/openmax).

This package includes the libomxil shared library together with the following OpenMAX 
components (built as separate shared objects and loaded at runtime):
- OMX alsa sink component
- OMX audio decoder based on ffmpeg library that supports the following audio formats:
  - MP3
  - WMA (still under debug process)
- OMX volume control component

The following simple test applications are provided:

test/components/alsasink/omxalsasinktest
test/components/ffmpeg/omxmp3dectest
test/components/ffmpeg/omx11audiodectest
test/components/audio_effects/omxvolcontroltest

Check the distribution build:

./configure
make
make install
make check

Before attempting to run any test, the OMX components *must* be registered
with the command:

/usr/local/bin/omxregister

that will create a file .omxregistry in the $HOME directory that will
contain all the components installed by default in
/usr/local/lib/omxcomponents
If the components are installed in a different directory, the omxregister 
command should be called as follows:
/usr/local/bin/omxregister component_installation_path


The test description is unde rdevelopment

HOW TO ADD A NEW COMPONENT
this description and a related document is under construction

-Test building with
 ./configure
 ./make
 ./make install

-If you have some test programs, put their sources into the 'test' directory.
 Edit the test/Makefile.am file to add rules for building them.
-Check correct building of your tests with:
 make check
-To build RPM:
 make dist
 cp libomxil-0.2.9.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
 rpmbuild -ba libomxil.spec
